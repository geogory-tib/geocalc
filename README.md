___
Building   
The only depedency this program requires is golang as it's written in go and only uses the stdlib
So simply type "go build" this will output a binary called "geocalc" but use the -o flag to name it whatever 
___
Future Goals
1. Clean up some of the code because it looks like crap
2. Add floating points and exponents
3. Sqaure roots maybe?
